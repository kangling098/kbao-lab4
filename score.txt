Hi Kanglin, I can see you've done a lot of coding and I can identify where you are fulfilling the requirements of the specification, but in order to get this project to run I had to completely disable your embedded glassfish dependency/code and I also had to specify the unitName for the EntityManager in AbstractService. Even then, it doesn't "work" per se because there are no security users loaded to the database. I can see you started an authenticate method in userService, but that's not the right idea. We don't want to work with the clear text password, it is much preferable to delegate handling of that to the underlying security framework in the application server. Aside from that, however, it just doesn't work because you didn't load security users to the database. I can see some good work here, but it's not a functional project yet.
